        <h2>Sample 1</h2>
        <p class="txt-r">This is a biography I wrote in my 10th grade english class about John Ernst Steinbeck Jr. We had to make a portfolio on the book Of Mice and Men, which included a biography on the author. I chose this sample because it shows how i can take information and apply it to the text to make a biography.</p>

        <h2> Sample 2</h2>
        <p class="txt-r">This sample is based off of the book Lord of the Flies. In my 10th grade english class we had to act out a funeral for Piggy, one of the main characters. This is both a creative and academic piece since I added a lot of made up things that were not in the book. I chose this sample because it shows a more creative side than academic. </p>
