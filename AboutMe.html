    <h1>Aout Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Breanna Creason, I live in Fresno, California and attend Sunnyside High School as well as The Center For Advanced Research and Technology. After high school, I plan to stay here to attend Fresno City college and study Graphic communication. The courses are a mixture of what i’m already at both Sunnyside and Cart. 
	Some of my hobbies are filming, drawing and looking at the different styles/layouts of houses. Drawing houses are my specialty though. I am also in the Video Production Academy at Sunnyside high school. I like learning to learn new skills which is the reason why I decided to join both Web Application Development and Video production. It’s like i’m testing what’s out there before I graduate and have to decide on one work field. 
	I would love it if you took a look around my website! If you’re interested in what I do or have on here, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or go to my contact page for more options.
